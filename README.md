## Installation

[![Run on Repl.it](https://replit.com/badge/github/Gam3rBoy57/SkinPeekReplit)](https://replit.com/github/Gam3rBoy57/SkinPeekReplit)
- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) with the `bot` and `applications.commands` scope
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) v16.6 or newer
- Clone/[Download](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) the repo, rename the `config.json.example` file to `config.json` and put your bot token into it.
- [Open a command prompt in the same folder](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-from-right-click-menu#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20command%20prompt%20window%20in%20any%20folder%2C%20simply,the%20same%20inside%20any%20folder.) and type `npm i` to install dependencies
- Run [SkinPeek.js](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/SkinPeek.js) using `node SkinPeek.js` in the command prompt
- Give the bot a [role](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206029707-Setting-Up-Permissions-FAQ) that allows it to send messages and create custom emojis
- Send `!deploy guild` or `!deploy global` to deploy the commands.

Deploying in the guild happens instantly but the commands can only be used in that guild. Deploying globally can take up to an hour due to Discord's caching.  
If you deployed both globally and in a guild, you will see every command twice. In that case, just send `!undeploy guild`!

By default, the bot doesn't store your username/password, it only uses them to get the cookies that can be used to generate access tokens needed to get your shop.  
You can log in using [your auth.riotgames.com cookies](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/wiki/How-to-get-your-Riot-cookies) using `/cookies` to avoid sending your password, and you can delete your account from the bot using `/forget`.  
Obviously, only log in if you trust whoever is hosting the bot, as they can theoretically do anything with your account.

If you're bored, check out [this writeup](https://gist.github.com/giorgi-o/e0fc2f6160a5fd43f05be8567ad6fdd7) on how Riot treats third-party projects like this one.

### Docker

For advanced users who want to deploy the bot using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/):

- [Create a discord bot](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot) and [add it to your server](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/adding-your-bot-to-servers.html#creating-and-using-your-invite-link) with the  bot and `applications.commands` scope
- Create a docker-compose file like [this](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) and a config file like [this](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/config.json.example)
- Put your bot token in [config.json](https://github.com/giorgi-o/SkinPeek/blob/master/config.json.example)
- Use `docker-compose up -d` to start the bot, `docker-compose logs -f` to see the logs and `docker-compose down` to stop it.
- Send `!deploy guild` to deploy in the current guild or `!deploy global` to deploy the commands globally.

## Translations

If you are fluent in another language and would like help translate the bot, please do!

1. Look up the language code for your language [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales)
2. Look in the bot's `languages` folder
3. If you're starting from scratch, copy the `en-GB.json` file and rename it to your language code
4. Open the file and do the thing

Once you're done translating, you can either [fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and [open a GitHub pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request), or you can just send me the JSON on discord and I'll upload it for you.

Thank you! :)
